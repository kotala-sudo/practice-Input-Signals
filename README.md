# practice-Input-Signals

This is a starter project to learn about using Input( ) signals. It is currently using @Input( ) decorator for data communication.

The project provides a simple input form to allow a user to enter a name of a snack and the application filters the snack list to displaying the matching criteria.
This project currently uses @Input( ) decorator for data communication between Snack (parent component) and Snack-List (Child Component).

In this exercise we will replace use of @Input( ) decorator with Signal inputs - input( ) function that was introduced in Angualar 17.1 to create input properties which are signals thus reactive.
